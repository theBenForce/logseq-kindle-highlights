# Development

To work on "My Highlights", install all dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Next, start the development server, this will allow you to make changes to
the plugin and see it updated in logseq.

```bash
yarn dev
```

Finally, load the plugin by opening the logseq plugins dialog and click
"Load unpacked plugin" to the right of the Plugins/Themes tabs. Select
this project's root directory and you should be good to go!

> *Note*: If you don't see the option to load an unpacked plugin, check
> in the "Settings" dialog, under "Advanced" to make sure you have
> "Developer mode" enabled.
